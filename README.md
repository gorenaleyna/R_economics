# R_economics
Basically here i am sharing my works in my studies to help more people. I show how did I overcome some challenges and most of them are R scripts. There is panel data, time series data and also cross-sectional data too. My main aim is to help other students so if you have any problems do not hesitate to ask. Most of the time I do not use chatgpt while coding because it is best when you can code yourself. 
There will be also a file that i use for my TUBITAK project, i will upload it after I publish my paper about this project.
